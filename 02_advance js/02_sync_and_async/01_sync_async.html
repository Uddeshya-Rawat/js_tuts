<!---  Javascript is a single thread leanguage that means it run on a single thread unlike many other languages. This means that javscript code runs in synchronous way or line by line .
In execution context each line is run one by one .Each operation waits for last operation to get executed .

BLOCKING CODE:- blocking code blocks the flow of execution until the work is done.
               ex- reading a file and getting data from it for further use in program.

NON BLOCKING CODE:- it doesnt break the flow of execution.
